        Diller Scofidio + Renfro (DS+R) is an interdisciplinary design studio that
        works at the intersection of architecture, the visual arts, and the performing arts.
        Founded in 1981, the New York-based studio established its identity through independent,
        conceptual, and self-generated art and architecture installations before reaching international
        prominence with large cultural and civic projects such as Blur Building at the 2002 Swiss Expo;
        the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston; the redevelopment of the Lincoln Center for the
        Performing Arts in New York; and the High Line in New York. Today, DS+R is led by four partners—
        Elizabeth Diller, Ricardo Scofidio, Charles Renfro and Benjamin Gilmartin—who work collaboratively
        with a staff of over 100 architects, designers, artists, and researchers.
